\section{OpenAPI} \label{_openAPI}
OpenAPI specifications (aka Swagger) are used in this project to create an easy to
understand interface to connect frontend service with
backend microservices.
It's useful since it provides mock for all APIs and produce a documentation about the contract of each one.\\
